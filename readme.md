INTRODUCTION
------------

MultiTool is a basic cryptography tool that enabled decoding/encoding Morse, Base64, and ASCII. It is a very simple tool that can be used for ARG's and CTF's.
There will likely be a few more modules added and further changes made to cover the basics and made it more robust. Features such as verifying the input has been classified correctly, is a valid typem etc., should be implemented..
