# Introduction / Overview

MultiTool is a basic cryptography tool that enabled decoding/encoding Morse, Base64, Ceaser Ciphers, and ASCII. It's very simple and can be used for ARG's and CTF's.
I will likely add features, and make further changes to cover the basics and make it more robust. 

## Issues

This is more for my learning than anything else, and these are likely not the most efficient methods to accomplish these tasks.
